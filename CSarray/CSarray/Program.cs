            An array is a collection of similar types of data.
            For example, 
            if we want to store the names of 100 people then we can create an array of the string type that can store 100 names.
            String[] array = new String[100];

            How to declare an array:
            dataType[] arrayName;

            To define the number of elements that an array can hold, we have to allocate memory for the array in C#.
            // declare an array
            double[] data;

            // allocate memory
            data = new Double[10];

            In c#, we can initialize arrays during declaration:
             //declare and initialize and array
            int[] age = {12, 4, 5, 2, 5};

            Here, we have created an array named age and initialized it with the values inside the curly brackets.
            Note that we have not provided the size of the array. 
            In this case, the Java compiler automatically specifies the size by counting the number of elements in the array (i.e. 5).
            In the Java array, each memory location is associated with a number. 
            The number is known as an array index.
            We can also initialize arrays in c#, using the index number. 
            // declare an array
            int[] age = new int[5];

            // initialize array
            age[0] = 12;
            age[1] = 4;
            age[2] = 5;
             */

        }
    }
}
