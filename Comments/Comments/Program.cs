             Write comments as if they were for you: (in fact, they are)

            When it comes to commenting code, think not only about the developers who will maintain your code in the future, but also think about yourself. 
            In the words of the great Phil Haack:

            "As soon as a line of code is laid on the screen, you're in maintenance mode on that piece of code."

            As a result, we ourselves will be the first beneficiaries (or victims) of our good (or bad) comments.

            Write a comment in a polite manner:

            Avoid rude and harsh comments:
            You never know who may read these comments in the future: your boss, a customer, or the pathetically inept developer you just insulted. 
            So maintain your respect and dignity.

            The golden rule:

            Let the code speak for itself. 
            You code should be written in such a way that everyone should easily understand it.
